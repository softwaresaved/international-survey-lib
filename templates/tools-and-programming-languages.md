# Tools and programming languages

1. TOC
{:toc}

On technical details we wanted to know which of the programming languages are mostly used by the RSEs. We give them a multi-choice list inspired by the [results published by Stackoverflow](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#most-popular-technologies).

We also wanted to know which operating system they use for work.

Questions in this section:

* Which operating system do you primarily use for development? (one choice)
* What programming languages do you use at work? Please select all that apply.
